    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      From coding challenges that measure the wrong things, to demoralizing whiteboarding or live-coding interviews that only seem to cause and placate impostor syndrome, reduce diversity and place applicants under significant stress, it is obvious that things are broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's time that tech workers demand a better interview process. How do we do that? Simple!
    </p>
    <h2>Step 1</h2>
    <p>
      Review <a href="/companies-that-whiteboard.html">the list</a> of companies that whiteboard.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 2</h2>

    <h3>I'm Looking for a Job</h3>
    <p>
      If you are looking for a job, only apply and accept interview requests with companies that do not whiteboard. A handy list of companies that do not whiteboard may be found, courtesy of <a href="https://github.com/poteto/hiring-without-whiteboards">Hiring Without Whiteboards</a>. Decline interview requests with companies that do whiteboard. Be sure to explain why you are declining to interview with a given company.

      Please have a look at why <a href="/interview_types/whiteboarding_and_live_coding.html">whiteboarding is bad</a>. This next part is easier said than done, but please fix your process. It will benefit you in the long run. Plus, you will be removed from <a href="/companies-that-whiteboard.html">the list</a>.
